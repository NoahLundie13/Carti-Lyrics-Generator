Yeah, now
Now is my time
Now is my time
(That-that-that-that-that-that be Maaly Raw)
Everybody rock with me because I'm up now
Took your girl and I'ma score like I made the touchdown
Swervin' in that Lambo', doors go up, not on a bus now
Used to want a G-Shock, now I'm walkin' with a bustdown
Pull up and I'm flooded with a iced out watch
Whip, it look like butter, baby, pecan drop
Pecan drop, put that four in Sun Drop
Stack my knots, count a lot, saw a lot
Got 'em rocks, diamond rocks, whip the pot
Suicide, 1600, that's the block
Hit your girl, that's check-free, she ain't used to text me
Now she wanna caress me, she keep tryna neck me
I gotta tell my bestie, someone call my bestie
Think I found my bestie, link up, make a check bleed
You know that I'm smokin' dope, I'll be high 'til next week
Know I had to let her go 'cause she can't arrest me
Uh, woke up with my toolie, what it do? Huh, uh
Meet me in the alley with the troops, uh
I got red shooters, I got blue, huh, yeah
Let that thing down and point at you, huh, uh
Bentley or the 'Rari, ho, let's choose, ooh
We gon' rob the bank, bring the loot, uh, uh
We gon' take these boys back to school, uh
Money on the floor just like some shoes
Uh, money on the floor just like some shoes, yeah
I'ma fuck your thot, she just a swoop, hah, yeah
I'ma fuck your thot, she just a swoop, hah, yeah
And I love my goons, yeah
And I love my tool (yeah), yeah (yeah)
And I love my loot (what?), yeah
Fuck with me and you gon' lose (what?)
Don't talk to me, just talk to my lil' dude
Don't talk to me, just talk to my lil' dude
Uh, woke up with my toolie, what it do? Huh, uh
Meet me in the alley with the troops, uh
I got red shooters, I got blue, huh, yeah
Let that thing down and point at you, huh, uh
Bentley or the 'Rari, ho, let's choose, ooh
We gon' rob the bank, bring the loot, uh, uh
We gon' take these boys back to school, uh
Money on the floor just like some shoes
